          # 2) For each vulnerable package, extract and include:

          # - Note if patches are available

          # Assign the issue to @github-copilot for automated remediation.

          Run a Qualys SCA scan on the current repository.

          Remediation plan:
          - Parse findings and for each vulnerability capture:
            - Package name and version
            - CVE/QID
            - Severity (CVSS/QDS if available)
            - File path(s) where the package was found (from Qualys report)
            - Patch/fixed version (if available)
          - Apply minimal, safe upgrades or patches:
            - Respect semver and ecosystem norms
            - Update manifests and lockfiles (e.g., package.json + lockfile, requirements*.txt, go.mod/go.sum, pom.xml, etc.)
            - If code changes are needed (API breaks), implement them.
          - Validate:
            - Reinstall/resolve deps
            - Run lint, type checks, unit/integration tests, and build
          - Git/PR:
            - If validation passes:
              - Create branch: feat/sca-qualys-$(date +%Y%m%d)
              - Commit using Conventional Commits
              - Open a GitHub PR via @github with:
                - Title: Fix: SCA—Qualys vulnerability remediation
                - Body:
                  * Concise summary of issues fixed
                  * Markdown table: Package | From → To | CVE/QID | Severity | File Path(s)
                  * Notes on breaking changes or manual follow-ups
                  * Links to advisories/Qualys output
                - Labels: security, sca, automated-fix
            - If validation fails:
              - Open a DRAFT PR with the same title/labels
              - Include a section summarizing failing checks (key logs)
          - Important rules:
            - Do NOT create a GitHub Issue
            - Include file path(s) from Qualys results in the PR body
            - Push the branch to origin so the PR is created
